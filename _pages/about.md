## About Me

## My Past
Firstly, I'm fortunate to be born in a family forever with love. I'm proud to be the child from [Lishui, Zhejiang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%BD%E6%B0%B4%E5%B8%82), where all my life and dreams started. I spent 3 unforgetable years in [Hangzhou High School](http://www.hanggao1899.cn/) 🌸, where I met the warmest friends and teachers as family. I spent wonderful half year in [Madison, Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin), where I first time dived into a purely native environment in another culture setting. Appreciate all the encounters during my life journey.
