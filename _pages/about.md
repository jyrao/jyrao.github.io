## About Me
I'm now a senior undergraduate student majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering with Data Science minor degree at 〽️ [UMich-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/). I will pursue my Ph.D in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I'm researching on the topic of multi-modal learning supervised by [Prof. Weidi Xie](https://weidixie.github.io/) in the team of [Media Brain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/).

## My Past
Firstly, I'm fortunate to be born in a family forever with love. I'm proud to be the child from [Lishui, Zhejiang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%BD%E6%B0%B4%E5%B8%82), where all my life and dreams started. I spent 3 unforgetable years in [Hangzhou High School](http://www.hanggao1899.cn/) 🌸, where I met the warmest friends and teachers as family. I spent wonderful half year in [Madison, Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin), where I first time dived into purely native environment in another culture setting. Appreciate all the encounters during my life journey.

## My Sparetime
There are many icons in sports and music guiding me to deep thinking and to pursue excellence: 🏀🟥Houston Rockets, 🏀🟨Zhejiang Lions, ⚽🇩🇪Bayern Munich, 🎾🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿Andy Murray, 🏀🇨🇳Yao Ming and 🎤Li Jian. I'm recently concentrating on CUBAL games.
