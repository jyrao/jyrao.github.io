## About Me
I'm now a senior undergraduate student majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering at „ÄΩÔ∏è [UMich-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/), with Data Science minor. I will persue my Ph.D in Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I'm research on the topic of multi-modality learning following [Prof. Weidi Xie](https://weidixie.github.io/) in the team of [Media Brain](https://mediabrain.sjtu.edu.cn/).

## My Past
Fistly, I'm fortunate to be bron in a family forever with love. I'm proud to be the child from [Lishui, Zhejiang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%BD%E6%B0%B4%E5%B8%82), where all my life and dreams started. The most unforgetable years in my life is 3 years in [Hangzhou High School](http://www.hanggao1899.cn/) üå∏, where I met the greatest friends and teachers as family.

## My Sparetime
There are many icons in sports and music guiding me to deep thinking and pursuit of excellence: Houston Rockets, Zhejiang Lions, Bayern Munich, Andy Murray, Jeremy Lin and Jian Li. I'm recently concentrating CUBAL games.
