Teaching Assistant in FA2022, Advisor: [Prof. Ailin Zhang](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/33871/)

**Instructor:** Ailin Zhang (ailin.zhang@sjtu.edu.cn) TA: Jiayuan Rao

Fall, 2022

**Course Description**

This course is to introduce the art of computational methods in statistics and data science. With the help of R, Python, and C++, we will write computer code to implement the core algorithms in statistical computing.

We will cover the following topics:

• R and Python Basics

• Least squares regression, sweep operator, QR decomposition

• Eigen computation, Principal Component Analysis

• Logistic regression, Newton-Raphson.

• Feed-forward neural network, back-propagation

• Adaboost, coordinate descent.

• Ridge regression, spline.

• Lasso, stagewise regression, solution path.

• Factor analysis, EM.

• Random number generators, linear congruential, rejection, polar.

When going through the above topics, the focus will be on algorithms and especially pro-gramming, instead of theories of learning, inference and computing

**Recommended Reference**

The course is not built on top of a single textbook. Therefore I would strongly recommend you to participate in the lecture. However, the following references are useful:

1. R Programming for Data Science (2020) by Roger Peng.

2. Introduction to Data Science (2020) by Rafael Irizarry.

**Grading Policy**

The typical JI grading scale will be used. I reserve the right to curve the scale if there are less than 30% of students with grades ≥ A. The grade will count the assessments using the following proportions:

• 10% Attendance and Participation.

To get the full credit, you need to make > 90% of the attendance check. The rest 10% is your flex-time. Feel free to use it if you have something emergent.

If you only make > 80% of the attendance check, you will get 6 pt.

Otherwise, you get 0 pt.

• 40% Homework

• 20% Midterm

• 30% Final Project (15% for presentation, and 15% for the written report)

• 1%* Extra Credit

**Final Project**

For your final project, you will analyze some data using the methods we have talked about in class. You will write up your analysis in a written report, and will also make an oral presentation. The presentation will be only 4 minutes each in total.

**Office Hour**

Wednesday 2-4 PM or by appointment.
