1 Course overview

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the complex and intricate mechanisms at work in building our cities. We will examine various forms of existing or envisioned urban settlements from different sizes, times, cultures, and locations. Doing so, we will gradually introduce fundamentals in history, theory and practice of architecture, urban design and urban planning. While exploring the different theoretical and conceptual frameworks in which cities are constructed, we will focus on the various forces that determine their sustainability.

3 Course content and objectives

3.1 Course objectives

Urban forms and transport are the objects of society’s largest investments and represent the biggest sources of energy consumption. Therefore, this is vital for anyone involved in its technological design and infrastructural development to acquire a global understanding of the forces and agents at work in the physical evolution of our cities. To this end, attention will be drawn to various topics where outcomes are influencing the development of the built environment, these topics include: the relationship of land use and transportation planning, public investments, energy consumption, housing and employment patterns, mobility, public health and social equity. The course will cover specific sustainability topics, such as: energy and water consumption, waste management and recycling, as well as broad concepts such as liveability, walkability, bikeability, heritage conservation, commoning and smart city.

3.2 Detailed course content

In the light of contemporary problems and opportunities in sustainable design, students will develop a critical approach to the current state and the envisioned futures for our cities. More specifically, students will be asked to develop case studies on specific spaces, places, urban forms or modes of transport, and to assess the sustainability of their study object according to multiple standards presented in the lectures. By bringing those inputs into group discussions, they will actively contribute to a better understanding of the environmental, economical, sociocultural and aesthetic impacts of architecture and urbanism.

Students will leave the course with a greater awareness of the challenges posed by urban sustainability. The resulting global understanding of how urban forms correlate with social dilemmas and individual behaviours is vital to their future professional pursuits as it will provide them keys to develop effective design and conceptual solutions to human-centred problems without loosing sight of environment, culture and society.

4 Student evaluation

4.1 Grading policy

The final average will be composed of three “sub-grades”, apportioned as follows:

• Class attendance and participation to discussions: 20%

• Quizzes (based on weekly reading and videos) and exercises: 35%

• Project (Poster and Exhibition) – Sustainability assessment case study: 45%

4.2 Late Policy

For every assignments, a Late Policy will be applied as follows:

• Every submission exceeding the due time will receive a 25% penalty per day.

• Every submission of an essay must go through Turnitin.

• No submission accepted by email.

• Any submission not fully related to the topic of the week will be rejected.

4.3 Attendance Policy

Since the course is discussion-based, class attendance in person is mandatory.

• Online attendance will not count as actual class attendance unless instructors have been informed before hand and agreed that the student may be exempt from physical attendance due to special circumstances.

• Additionally, according to UM-SJTU JI regulations, class attendance is required. Attendance Policy will be applied as follow:

– To quote the JI policy on leave/missed classes: “An advance request for leave of absence is required if the student cannot attend the class due to illness or other reasons. Absence without approval will be regarded as skipping classes.”

– “A note that a student visited a medical facility is not a sufficient excuse for missing an assignment. The note must specifically indicate that the student was incapable of completing an assignment due to medical problems and that this condition was sudden enough that it was impractical to contact the instructor in advance.”

• Each student is responsible for all material covered in class, including lecture content, and schedule and policy changes.

4.4 Honor code

Each summary and case study must be a unique peace of work based on original research and personal understanding. The reuse of another student work or the reproduction of an existing investigation will automatically be sanctioned. When using parts of the course, textbooks or any other material,

sources must be clearly stated. Following the JI Honor Code Policy, any form of plagiarism will result in severe penalties.

5 General guidelines

To insure proper communication between the students and the teaching team, it is strongly recommended to observe the following guidelines:

• In the event of special circumstances that would greatly affect their work, students are expected to contact the teaching team as early as possible so that a solution could be found.

• For every email related to this course please include the course code in the subject.

• Any email addressed to a TA regarding major problems, such as a grade issue, should also be sent to the instructor as a carbon copy ( Cc ). In the absence of a written record, any later request will be automatically rejected.
